            Our movies are rated using the British Board of Film Classification:

                <h3>U Universal – Suitable for all</h3>
                <p>A U film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over, although it is impossible to predict what might
                upset any particular child.
            
                U films should be set within a positive framework and should offer reassuring counterbalances to any violence, threat or
                horror. If a work is particularly suitable for pre-school children, this will be indicated in the ratings info.</p>

                <p>                   
                    General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG film should not unsettle a child aged around
                    eight or older. Unaccompanied children of any age may watch, but parents are advised to consider whether the content may
                    upset younger, or more sensitive, children.

            <h3>12A/12 – Suitable for 12 years and over</h3>
            <p>
                Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that is not generally suitable for children aged
                under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult. Adults planning to take
                a child under 12 to view a 12A film should consider whether the film is suitable for that child. To help them decide, we
                recommend that they check the Ratings info for that film in advance. No one younger than 12 may rent or buy a 12 rated
                video work.
