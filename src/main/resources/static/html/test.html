                <h3>U Universal â€“ Suitable for all</h3>
                <p>A U film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over, although it is impossible to predict what might
                upset any particular child.
            
                U films should be set within a positive framework and should offer reassuring counterbalances to any violence, threat or
                horror. If a work is particularly suitable for pre-school children, this will be indicated in the ratings info.</p>

                <h3>PG Parental Guidance</h3>
                <p>                   
                    General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG film should not unsettle a child aged around
                    eight or older. Unaccompanied children of any age may watch, but parents are advised to consider whether the content may
                    upset younger, or more sensitive, children.
